# Purpose
This is a demo repository that showcases my 1-1-1 Setup, which I introduced on my blog [here](https://lietzau-consulting.de/2020/05/source-management-sfdx-part-1/).

# Directory Structure
The repository is meant to hold only a single SFDX project, which consists of only a single 2nd gen package. 
Why? So we have better control over permissions and can easily replicate all scripts and folders. See my blog post for more details.
